Student Management System with Tkinter GUI
This Python script implements a simple Student Management System (SMS) with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library. The SMS allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records.

Features:
Add Student: Allows users to input student details such as name, roll number, department, and major, and adds the student to the system.
View Student: Enables users to view details of a specific student by entering their roll number. If the student exists in the system, their details are displayed; otherwise, a message indicating that the student is not found is shown.
Update Student: Permits users to update the details of a student by providing the roll number of the student to be updated, along with the new name, department, and major. Upon successful update, a confirmation message is displayed; otherwise, a message indicating that the student is not found is shown.
Delete Student: Allows users to delete a student from the system by entering their roll number. Upon successful deletion, a confirmation message is displayed; otherwise, a message indicating that the student is not found is shown.
